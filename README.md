This webapp works in Chrome. I have not tested it in any other browser.

In this project I decided to use the prefix _ME when naming tag classes and ids. This is to avoid risking to give names that might already exist in the bootstrap.js framework. I don't know if that is a good idea but itÂ´s what I did.
